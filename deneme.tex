\section*{Question 1}

The purpose of this exercise is to provide an imaginary step-functioned current, $i_{e}$, to the neuron, and then to analyze the behavior of membrane voltage, $V_{m}$.The whole electrical activity of neuron is thought to be a parallel connected circuit with resistor and capacitor elements. This assumption leads us to use ``Single Compartment Model -SCM'', which basically models $V_{m}$, with the already known value of input current and time range.
